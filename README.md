# Title: Sales Insights with Customer Demographics

# Problem Statement
A company is analyzing the sales performance of its 20 products over the year 2023, with a particular interest in understanding customer demographics and the impact of targeted marketing on sales. The company aims to cater to a wide range of customers but is especially focused on increasing sales among female customers. Additionally, they are investing in several products that are not gender-specific, aiming to appeal to a broader audience.

# The company is interested in several key areas of analysis:

1. How are the products performing in the market? Are certain products more popular among specific demographic groups?
2. What are the overall revenue trends throughout the year, and how do they align with customer demographics like age and gender?
3. Does targeting wider age groups with certain products yield better results compared to focusing on specific demographics, especially when marketing on social media?
4. Are there particular products that perform better with broader or specific age group targets? How does this align with the companyâ€™s social media campaigns?
5. Ultimately, the company seeks to optimize its marketing strategies by understanding whether targeting a broader demographic is more effective than focusing on specific customer segments, particularly in relation to age and gender.
